                        This website will require you to type in various information to make the bake sale website. Each input will be a textbox and it will say what information it needs in grey. This includes picture urls. You can get these by right clicking on images that you find on various websites and clicking on the "Copy Image Address". Then simpily click on the place on the "Make Website" you wish to put the url in and right click and hit paste or click on your "ctrl" and "V" buttons in order to place the url you got into the selected spot. It should also be noted, all food items you make on this website will have the option to order up to 10 via a drop down. Aside from that, everything else should be straight forward. If you have any questions feel free to contact the creator in the creator section. With that out of the way, have fun and enjoy the site!
